# Grocery List Web App – Database Application Project, University of Helsinki (Summer 2023)
This web-based app is coursework for the University of Helsinki Database Application Project course. The aim is to create a web-based application to make a life just a bit easier by streamlining one of the most tedious parts of your weekly shop – i.e. compiling a shopping list.

## Project overview
Main functionalities:
+ The user can register/log in
+ The user can create/save shopping lists
+ The user can view their previous shopping lists
+ The shopping list items are put into categories (fruit & veg, chilled food, frozen food, household items, etc.) for easier shopping

Super simple, right? Not to worry, if time is kind some of the following could be included:
+ The user can share a shopping list
+ The user can edit an existing shopping list
+ The user can add recipes (a least manually) from which the ingrediants are imported to a shopping list
+ The user can delete old shopping lists

For my own convenience, I have created a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Hk51ZoDV1AqUWWAYf6MvK6ZVflhoNZ81wzrthbtHzs/) to track the project progress. It includes a roadmap/backlog of sorts, checklists for deadlines, and I will probably use it for general planning/time keeping as well.
